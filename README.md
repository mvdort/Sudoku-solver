# Sudoku-solver

This program solves a simple sudoku (where no guessing is required).
You can play either with a standard sodoku, or ask the sovler to solve a specific sudoku
(for example: 080000200000084090006320010097000080800903002010000950070045800030710000008000040).

Note: sudoku's in which a guess is required, will not work in this version.
